Hi! Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Robotics at UC Berkeley, currently exploring the intersection of intelligent systems, optimization, and control. I work as a Graduate Student Researcher at [PATH](https://path.berkeley.edu), building large-scale traffic simulation tools to evaluate the impact of infrastructure changes on human and autonomous driver behavior.

Before Berkeley, I studied Mechanical Engineering at McGill University and interned at Tesla, Beta Technologies, and Vention, working on embedded systems, mechatronic design, and simulation tooling for robotic platforms.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in how learning-based systems can act, adapt, and reason in the real world. My current and past work has touched on:
- Model-based and learning-based control  
- Multi-agent systems and intelligent infrastructure  
- Simulation and optimization for embodied agents  
- Design and computation tools for robotics and autonomy
