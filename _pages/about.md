Hi! I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at UC Berkeley, currently exploring the intersection of intelligent systems, optimization, and control. I work as a Graduate Student Researcher at [PATH](https://path.berkeley.edu), building large-scale traffic simulation tools to evaluate the impact of infrastructure changes on human and autonomous driver behavior.

Before Berkeley, I studied Mechanical Engineering at McGill University and interned at Tesla, Beta Technologies, and Vention, working on embedded systems, mechatronic design, and simulation tooling for robotic platforms.

I’m broadly interested in how learning-based systems can act, adapt, and reason in the real world. My current and past work has touched on:
- Model-based and learning-based control  
- Multi-agent systems and intelligent infrastructure  
- Simulation and optimization for embodied agents  
- Design and computation tools for robotics and autonomy
